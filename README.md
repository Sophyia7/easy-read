# EASY-READ 

Easy-read is PDF to AudioBook script I built using pyttsx3 and PyPDF2. 

## USAGE 

- Download the zipped file. 
- Replace django-admin-cookbook.pdf with the PDF you want to turn to an audiobook in the main.py
- REplace myaudio.mp3 with whatver you wish you call your audiobook (optional)
- Run the code.

There you have it! Your audiobook!
